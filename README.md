# React-app

Hello! My name is Galina, this is my final project in [Web Hero School](https://webheroschool.ru/).

---

## About the project

This react-app consists of three parts: 
+ todo-list( you can create list of tasks, add, remove, mark them as 'done', use the filter to research)
+ 'about me' page (where you can find info about me, and watch the list of repositories on GitHub)
+ my contacts ( where is some info about me, my contacts and links to social networks, also, if you have any questions, you can use that info).

Welcome to my project => https://react-galina-ka.herokuapp.com/

The app was built with the help of 
classnames
react-router-dom
Material UI
octokit/rest
